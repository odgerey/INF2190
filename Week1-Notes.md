### statistic; summary used to describe data
### probability; evidence it gives us of data 
### machine learning; learning from using models

population; everybody/everything possible of data set
sample; the subset of population we actually have
(data) value; configuration that one data example takes on 
the variable; the "placeholder" X in alegbra

modes of central tendency; describe where most of the values in a data set are. The 3 main ones
Mode: most popular response
Median: the exact middle of the data set when ordered from low to high
Mean (the sum of all values divided by the number of values); x/n = x1 + x2

measures of variability; tell you how spread out the values in a data set are 4 common ones;
range >> the highest value minus th elowest value of the data set


f(x) = ax +b
same as y = ax +b 

no correlation = don't use machine learning, as there's not enough correlation to study
