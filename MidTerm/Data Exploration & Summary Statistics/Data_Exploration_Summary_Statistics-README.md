- Sample vs Population 
- Datasets
- Dimensions
- Features


# DEFINITIONS

## SAMPLE VS POPULATION

**Population** => The “full” theoretically possible set (e.g. all people with a certain
characteristic, all possible data examples with a certain feature).

**Sample** => The subset of the population we actually have and do analysis on (could be
biased, but we usually assume not).

**Underlying (data) distribution** => All the possible configurations of data examples and
how likely they (how they are ‘distributed’) for the population.

**Empiral (data)  distribution** => Distribution of the data we actually have.

**(data) value** => Configuration that one data example ‘takes on’ (e.g. 25, blue, …) x1 = 3.

**Variable** => The “placeholder” or abstract element of a dataset x.

## SUMMARY STATISTICS

**Measures of central tendency** => describe where most of the values in a data set are. 3
most common:

    **Mode** => the most popular response or value in the data set.

    **Median** => the value in the exact middle of the data set when ordered from low to high.

    **Mean (average)** => the sum of all values divided by the number of values.
    𝛍 = 𝝨 x /n = (x1 + x2 +...+ xn )/n

**Measures of variability** =>tell you how spread out the values in a data set are. 4
common ones:
    **Range** => the highest value minus the lowest value of the data set.
    
    **Interquartile range** => the range of the middle half of the data set.

    **Standard deviation** =>the average distance between each value in your data set and the mean.

    **Variance** => the square of the standard deviation.

## STANDARD DEVIATION

### Breaking down calculating the standard deviation

1. Deal with the mean & n first:

2. Calculate the difference between the data points and the mean:

3. Put everything together into the formula:

## CORRELATION AND COVARIANCE
Relationships between variables (e.g. x and y)

**Linear relationship** => y changes directly proportional to x (e.g. no “compounding” changes). Formula for a line: y = ax + b (a and b are parameters/constants/scalars)

**Function** =>the change/relationship (“y is a function of x”), often write f(x) instead of y

Linear relationship
y = mx + b

**m** SLOPE => Whereas "m" describes the slope of the lines.

**b** Y-INTERCEPT => Whereas "b" describes where the line crosses the y-axis.
