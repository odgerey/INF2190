# Population
full theoretical
 
# Sample
subset of what we actually have

# Stats  
summary of data sample
Mode; most popular
Median; value in the middle
Mean; sum divided by number of values


# Measures of variability
- how spread out

# Standard deviation
distance between line of regression and points that deviate

# Linear relationship - straight line

# Non linear relationship = swirly line
point of intercept is 0


# Introduction to Probabilty
sample space is a collection of all possible outcomes of a trial. A light in an unknown room can either be on or off. What's the sample space? S = {On, Off} = {n,f}
Two lights: S = {On, Off} = {nn, ff, fn, nf}

Disjoint cannot be at the same time

random process; we know what outcomes will happen, but not which one
coin toss, dice roll, iTunes shuffle

a random variable is a value determined by random process 
Example; x = {heads, tails}   x is the possible values of heads or tails


Can be discrete; coin toss
continuous; height, weight.

event; what actually happened
Probability;
P(A=a); Probaility of random variable A taking on value of a
Two historical interpretations of stats & probability
Frequentist interpretation
bayesian interpretation

The Expected value or expectation of a random variable is the sum/integral  

law of large numbers; the more times you do it the closer you are to getting proportions


gamblers fallacy; despite a coin toss turning up heads, the probaility of a next toss coming up tails is still 50%. The "tails" isn't due to show up because it hasn't appeared in a while. 


P(X=h = 0.5, X = t=0.5)
Event X=t, X=h
Probability0.5, 0.5

Events need to be disjoint, the two can't happen at the same time
discrete (countable)

continuous probability 
zero likelihood
can only calculate over interval of value

Checking for independent event
P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)

What is the probability of getting two tails in a row
Tree diagram is best to see how probability works

Cocain relapse
48/72
P(relapsed) approx 67%

P relapsed and desipramine

Bayes Theorum
P(A|B) = P(A) X P(B|A) / P(B)
Posterior prior likelihood marginal
